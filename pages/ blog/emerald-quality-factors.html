    <h1>Emerald Quality Factors — Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Rafael Ferreira — GIA Gemologist • Colored Stones</div>

    <h2>Color — The Primary Value Driver</h2>
    <p>The finest emeralds display a pure, vivid green to bluish green hue. According to GIA standards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hue:</strong> Dominant green, sometimes with slight blue modifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Medium to medium-dark; too light is not classified as emerald.</li>
      <li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Strong to vivid saturation maximizes value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarity — Accepting the Jardin</h2>
    <p>Unlike diamonds, emeralds almost always contain inclusions known as the <em>jardin</em> (garden). GIA recognizes that moderate inclusions are acceptable as long as they do not compromise transparency or durability.</p>

    <h2>Cut — Maximizing Color & Durability</h2>
    <p>The traditional <strong>emerald cut</strong> (rectangular step cut) reduces stress on the stone and highlights its color. Skilled cutting minimizes visibility of inclusions while maximizing face-up appearance.</p>

    <h2>Carat Weight</h2>
    <p>Fine-quality emeralds above 1–2 carats command exponential value increases. Large, clean stones are exceedingly rare, especially from Colombia’s Muzo mines or Zambia’s Kagem deposit.</p>

    <p><em>Emerald grading is nuanced—value is not just size, but the balance of its four Cs under GIA’s colored stone standards.</em></p>
