    <h1>The Diamond Formation Journey — From Earth’s Mantle to Market</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Rafael Ferreira — GIA Gemologist • Diamonds</div>

    <p>Diamonds are the only gemstones formed under extreme conditions that exist more than 150 km beneath the Earth’s surface, where pressure exceeds 725,000 pounds per square inch and temperatures rise above 1,200°C. Their journey to the surface and eventually into jewelry is both scientific and extraordinary.</p>

    <h2>Formation in the Mantle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carbon Source:</strong> Carbon crystallizes into diamond only under specific pressure-temperature fields known as the "diamond stability field".</li>
      <li><strong>Geological Age:</strong> Most natural diamonds are 1–3 billion years old, making them some of the oldest materials on Earth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transport to the Surface</h2>
    <p>Diamonds reach the surface through rare volcanic eruptions that form <strong>kimberlite and lamproite pipes</strong>. These eruptions act as elevators, bringing the crystals to mineable depths in a matter of hours.</p>

    <h2>Mining and Sorting</h2>
    <p>Modern diamond recovery includes both open-pit and underground mining. Once extracted, diamonds are sorted by size, shape, and quality. Rough stones suitable for gem use are a small fraction of the total mined material.</p>

    <h2>Cutting & Market Journey</h2>
    <p>Cutting transforms rough into polished gemstones, maximizing brilliance and yield. Diamonds then pass through international trading centers such as Antwerp, Mumbai, and New York before reaching jewelry retailers.</p>

    <p><em>Understanding diamond formation enhances appreciation for their rarity and value. As a GIA gemologist, my role is to connect this science with consumer confidence.</em></p>
