    <h1>Synthetic vs. Natural Gems — Identification & Disclosure</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Rafael Ferreira — GIA Gemologist • Gem Identification</div>

    <h2>Definition of Synthetic Gems</h2>
    <p>Synthetics are <strong>man-made crystals with the same chemical composition and structure as their natural counterparts</strong>. A synthetic emerald, for example, is still beryl (Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈), but grown in a lab instead of the Earth.</p>

    <h2>Key Identification Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magnification:</strong> Natural gems often contain inclusions like crystals, growth tubes, or "fingerprints". Synthetics may show curved striae or metallic flux residues.</li>
      <li><strong>Refractometer:</strong> Confirms refractive index consistent with natural species.</li>
      <li><strong>UV Fluorescence:</strong> Some synthetics fluoresce differently than natural counterparts.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Testing:</strong> Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and inclusion analysis at labs like GIA confirm origin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disclosure & Ethics</h2>
    <p>GIA and professional associations require full disclosure of treatments and synthetic origins. Transparency protects consumer confidence and professional integrity.</p>

    <h2>Market Perspective</h2>
    <p>Synthetics provide affordable alternatives and are increasingly popular in bridal jewelry. Natural stones, however, retain greater rarity and long-term value.</p>
